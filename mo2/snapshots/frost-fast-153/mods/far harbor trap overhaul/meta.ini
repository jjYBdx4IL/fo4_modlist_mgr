nexusDescription="Were u also excited after installing Far Harbor, going through the chemistry station finding a new tap called traps?\r<br />So was i till i used the first trap noticing the little advantage and the huge weight (especially at playing on survival) of the traps.\r<br />\r<br />I decided to have a look at it using FO4 edit.\r<br />This is what i came up with:\r<br />-wrong description: the Bear Trap actually did 40 damage instead of 30 as the description suggested\r<br />-no crippling, limb damage or even [color=#ff0000]stagger [/color](definitely a bug&#33;): I am pretty sure, it was intended to work as described but it was to time consuming. So they thought just dealing 30 damage to the health and having a medium stagger is enough. Poor job and a lying description. -_- sad.\r<br />\r<br />Anyway, here is my solution:\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.1.0:\r<br />Caltrops:\r<br />\xa0 Damage: 2 -&gt; 4 \xa0 \xa0//more a gimmick but the poisoned one should deal some damage.\r<br />\xa0\xa0Slow 0 -&gt; 15%; \xa0\x44uration: 0 -&gt; 13sec \xa0 \xa0//they now apply a slow, if you experience any trouble let me know&#33;\r<br />\xa0 Reduced weight: 0.5 -&gt; 0.3 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0//as u cant pick them back up and to compete with grenades in some way (mainly for survival).\r<br />\xa0 Increased projectiles: 5 -&gt; 7 \xa0 \xa0//to increase the stopping power, as they sometimes don&#39;t trigger.\r<br />\r<br />Poisoned Caltrops:\r<br />\xa0 Damage: 2 -&gt; 4; \xa0Poison damage; 2 -&gt; 3; Duration 5 -&gt; 15 \xa0 \xa0//wont scale -_-&#33;\r<br />\xa0\xa0Slow 0 -&gt; 25%; \xa0\x44uration: 0 -&gt; 15sec \xa0 \xa0//they now apply a slow, if you experience any trouble let me know&#33;\r<br />\xa0 Reduced weight: 0.5 -&gt; 0.3 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0//as u cant pick them back up and to compete with grenades in some way (mainly for survival).\r<br />\xa0 Increased projectiles: 5 -&gt; 7 \xa0 \xa0//to increase the stopping power, as they sometimes don&#39;t trigger.\r<br />\r<br />Bear Trap:\r<br />\xa0 Changed description to:\xa0High leg damage.

Only player placed traps are affected thus easy to handle.\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility:\r<br />\xa0 [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/3877/?]VIS[/url]\xa0patch available (also sorts the traps to the bottom&#33;&#33; Sort top mod can be easily done if requested).\r<br />\xa0 Runs with every weapon mod if placed afterwards (like [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2463/?]WBO[/url]\xa0\x65.g.)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />#1 Calculation:\r<br />\xa0 Bear Trap example, Sharpened Bear Trap according to it:\r<br />\xa0 Checking the leg condition of the OTHER leg, if it is above the set bound and hits a certain percentage, it damages the targeted leg.\r<br />\xa0 Resulting in only damaging one if the other is still intact. If one leg gets damaged during this process, it damages the health.\r<br />\xa0 Then checking whether one leg is below a certain bound and the other above a certain bound. If so and it hits the right percentage, it kills it and dealing\r<br />\xa0 extra damage.\r<br />\xa0 I wanted the traps to never cripple both legs, as it would be way to strong and doesn&#39;t make much sense anyway. Also placing two traps shouldn&#39;t be\r<br />\xa0 to\xa0strong due to the\xa0\x62reak chance and the heavy\xa0weight\xa0\x61lthough it has a very high chance of instant crippling. \r<br />\xa0 If you encounter a melee attacker just shoot the\xa0legs first. Together with the bear trap u have very decent stopping power.\r<br />\r<br />#2 Planned or possible changes:\r<br />- \xa0I am currently thinking about removing the perk requirements for the basic bear trap, as u most likely will use it as a ranged kind of player.\r<br />\xa0 \xa0\x42ut if the traps are good enough, maybe its worth it spending a point into it ;). // rather not, therefor you have the Caltrops\r<br />(- \xa0Increasing the Caltrop damage.)\r<br />(- \xa0thinking of having to break chances for the bear trap, about 35% for the rusty version and 20-25% for the shiny one.) V1.1.0\r<br />(- \xa0Probably changing the weight of the Bear Traps to make them more useful)\xa0V1.1.0\r<br />- \xa0\x41\x64\x64ing a &#34;no really big creatures&#34; as it would be OP if you just cripple a Deathclaw with it\r<br />- \xa0\x41s often requested there is probably going to be an op-version to always cripple and stuff..\r<br />\r<br />\xa0\r<br />If you find any language mistakes, let me know. It&#39;s not my mother language :)\r<br />Have Fun&#33;"
