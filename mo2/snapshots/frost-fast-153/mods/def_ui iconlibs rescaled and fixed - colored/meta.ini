These issues made the interface look very inconsistent. I started with fixing the existing assets but soon realized that most of them were in need of a redesign. I think its important to stick to a certain icon style that fits to the existing vanilla assets.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Design Direction[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]icons follow one style which is bold/filled, no mixing with other styles like outline\n<br />[*]simple and streamlined designs, no unnecessary detail that is not visible in render size\n<br />[*]references to vanilla objects and reuse of existing icons that are already part of the interface\n<br />[*]no outlines, no background, no multicolor, all icons are a single merged object\n<br />[*]small selection of pastel colors to categorize item types\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Technical Details[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]alignment and offset issues are fixed in the bounding box of the vector graphic, no ugly outlines\n<br />[*]icons are always centered in their bounding box, horizontally and vertically\n<br />[*]redesigned icons are optimized and use a minimal amount of nodes for the given shape\n<br />[*]no redundant layers, shape complexity, or other unnecessary data\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Keep in mind that even though every single icon has been retouched and fixed in terms of bounds and scaling, not everything has been redesigned yet. The library contains a lot of assets, and I only focused on the most important and widely used ones. To make sure the library is backwards compatible, I inherited the icon references from previous libraries.\n<br />\n<br />[font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=5]INSTALLATION[/size][/font]\n<br />\n<br />This mod just contains interface files, it is safe to add/remove/update at any time. Make sure to give the files from this mod priority in your mod manager.\n<br />\n<br />I recommend to use\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194]Mod Organizer 2[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=5]NOTES[/size][/font]\n<br />\n<br />If you are using the colored icon library, I recommend to use the following settings and mods to have correctly colored icons in every interface of the game. This covers container/barter interface, Pip-Boy interface and the PA Pip-Boy interface. Some of those changes also improve clarity and readability.\n<br />\n<br />To have a sharp and more readable Pip-Boy screen like in the second screenshot, add the following line:\n<br />\n<br />[font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=4][Pipboy]\n<br />bPipboyDisableFX=1[/size][/font]\n<br />\n<br />For proper coloring in all inventory screens, your HUD color has to be white. You can do this\xa0\x62y adding:\n<br />\n<br />[font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=4][Interface]\n<br />iHUDColorR=255\n<br />iHUDColorG=255\n<br />iHUDColorB=255[/size][/font]\n<br />\n<br />For a white HUD when in Power Armor, use these settings. This changes the HUD color, but not the rest of the PA HUD elements:\n<br />\n<br />[font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=4][Pipboy]\n<br />fPAEffectColorR=1\n<br />fPAEffectColorG=1\n<br />fPAEffectColorB=1[/size][/font]\n<br />\n<br />You don't have to change these color settings for the Pip-Boy, as this is already handled by disabling all Pip-Boy screen effects with the first line.\n<br />\n<br />Even with all these settings, the PA Pip-Boy screen is still very bright and washes out the colors. To help with that, add the following lines:\n<br />\n<br />[font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=4][Display][/size]\n<br />[size=4]fPipboyScreenEmitIntensityPA=1[/size]\n<br />[size=4]fPipboyScreenDiffuseIntensityPA=0[/size][/font]\n<br />\n<br />I also recommend to use\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/8854]Power Armor Map Fix[/url]\xa0to further help with the bright interface and map screen.\n<br />\n<br />Lastly, if you want everything to be in line with the white HUD, you can use the white variant of\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/676]Different Colors for Power Armor HUD[/url].\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Be sure to report any problems you may find in the comments!"
