nexusDescription="[size=3]In vanilla Fallout 4, [url=https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Eleanor]Eleanor[/url]\xfeff is a vendor at an unmarked location a short walk northwest of Fairline Hill Estates. FROST changes her to a hostile survivor who attacks nearly on sight.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />To me, FROST already has a big shortage of vendors and the removal of Eleanor as an option to trade for supplies was disappointing. This patch restores Eleanor to her role as a friendly vendor (similar to Opal, but not as well stocked). She has been renamed \"Survivor\" to fit in with FROST, and has been given a \"FROST-ified\" outfit. Her inventory has been untouched and will reflect FROST's changes to vendor leveled lists.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />If you are using my [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/36587]Commonwealth Couriers Express Stations[/url]\xfeff mod, she is located right behind the Road House Courier Station.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />The .esp is flagged with an ESL header so it will not count towards your load order.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ffff00]IMPORTANT!:[/color] This patch [color=#ffff00]MUST[/color] be loaded after FROST. Place this mod BELOW FROST your load order or it WILL NOT work!\n<br />\n<br />[/b][/size][color=#f1c232][size=4][b]Other Notes:[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />1. This mod is PC only. There will not be a console version, so please do not ask.\n<br />\n<br />2. There is no settlement workshop in any of the cells and I will never add one so please don\x2019t ask.\n<br />\n<br />3. Based on any texture replacements you have installed in your game, the appearance of items in the mod may vary from what is shown in the screenshots and promo video. I use many texture replacements in my game and videos, and none of them are included in this mod.\n<br />\n<br />4. I make mods for myself first and foremost. They are created for my game with my gameplay style in mind, according to my tastes and standards. I do not take requests nor suggestions for changes. If one of my mods doesn\x2019t run on your computer, or it doesn\x2019t fit in with your personal preference, or it doesn\x2019t have a feature that you would want, I would respectfully suggest (and encourage) that you learn to use the modding tools that are freely available to change the mod yourself to your liking.\n<br />\n<br />I use the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/17631/?]Decent Plus ENB preset[/url] for my screenshots, videos and gameplay.\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/38167085/?tb=mods&amp;pUp=1]\n<br />[img]http://www.sublevel3.com/nexus/tags/rrtv-mods-tag.jpg[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUJxQOW5zmdg2ucaOYIj3Kw]\n<br />[img]http://www.sublevel3.com/nexus/mfi/nexus-rrtv-banner.png[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#f1c232][size=4]YouTubers:\n<br />[/size][/color][/b][b][color=#ffff00][size=3]You are welcome to use/showcase my mods in your reviews, mod showcases, and Let's Play videos. \n<br />But, you ARE NOT under any circumstances\xa0\x61llowed to upload, share or otherwise distribute this mod or any of its files to any mod \x201csharing\x201d service such as ModDrop.[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232][size=4][b]Licensing/Legal:\xa0[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[size=3]Do not redistribute or alter this work or any of the files contained therein without explicit written consent from the original author (RedRocketTV).
