nexusDescription="[center]\r<br />[font=Comic Sans MS][size=4][b]Realistic Melee Range[/b][/size][/font]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Arial]Several edits to melee range for both player and npcs. The game default setting is far beyond realism, which basically makes a machete to an invisible long spear and enemies can kill you from the air. It is extremely immersion breaking and also difficult to predict and dodge. If you are playing\xa0\x61 difficulty that you can only take 1 or 2 hits before going down, this is exactly what you want in your load order.[/font]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[font=Comic Sans MS][size=4][b]Disable Enemy Killmove[/b][/size][/font]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Arial]The optional file is made for Frost users mainly, what it does is disabling Human enemies&#39; killmove. The default game setting is that if one hit takes out more than 50% player&#39;s hp, there is a chance a killmove\xa0will be triggered. Left killmove enabled basically makes melee combat in Frost frustrating as enemy will constantly\xa0\x65xecute you even you have a lot of health. This mod gives you the chance to fight back even though you still gonna die a lot, in a satisfying way at least. Bigger enemies such as Death claw left untouched as they are supposed to kill you in one hit.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/font][font=Comic Sans MS][size=4]Compatibility[/size][/font]\r<br />\r<br />Some edits to game default records, no script involved, should not cause any problems. Put as low as possible in your loader for maximum compatibility.\r<br />\xa0\xa0[/center]"
