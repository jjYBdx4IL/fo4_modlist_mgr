nexusDescription="[b]INFO:[/b]\n<br />In FROST, NPCs can only use the amount of ammo that's in their inventories when they spawn in. If they run out of ammo, they switch to melee and drop no ammo when they die. This leads to ammo scarcity, which is fine for most people since it adds to immersion. But this also has the effect of making combat situations easier, since the player can simply wait until npcs run out of ammo and then pick off the melee combatants one by one as they charge.\n<br />\n<br />[u]If you want NPCs to fight with unlimited ammo like in vanilla, you will need to use this mod.[/u] NPCs will only drop whatever ammo they spawned with. They won't be given more ammo, they just won't use it all up.\n<br />[b]\n<br />There are two versions of this mod. [size=4]USE ONE OR THE OTHER, [u]NOT BOTH[/u][/size]\n<br />[/b][list=1]\n<br />[*]The first version is used if you're just playing FROST [u]without[/u] a Simplified Sorting FROST patch.
