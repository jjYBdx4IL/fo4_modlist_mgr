It also can be that certain locations will reset in a current play through. Not all features are included yet, the Hallucination system, a few new NPCs, journals and notes are still in development. \n<br />Certain bug fixes mods for FROST are incompatible/already included. Please load my mod [u]after[/u] these mods, or remove them.[size=5][color=#ff7700][size=3] The changelog below is not complete, because this mod changes so much that I can't remember \n<br />everything.

A few immersion things (Doctors Dialogue, a few BoS related static objects) could be fixed, but it would take hours to do so, and that is not worth my time.
