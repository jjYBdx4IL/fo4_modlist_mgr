This mod is entirely a mesh replacer, there is no ESP or ESL file which should maintain compatibility with almost everything.\xa0[/i]\n<br />-----\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]~ Whats Included? ~[/b][/size]\n<br />-------\n<br />[b]Pipe Rifle/Pistol/SMG[/b]\n<br />[ Fully Remade ]\n<br />[b]Pipe Bolt-Action Rifle[/b]\n<br />[ Fully Remade ]\n<br />[b]Pipe Revolver[/b]\n<br />[ Lightly Edited ]\n<br />[b]Syringer[/b]\n<br />[ Minor Edit ]\n<br />[b]\xa0[/b]\n<br />[b]\"Pipe Rifle\" Palate[/b]\n<br />[ This mod includes my personal simple pipe palate. This effects the entire family of guns. ]\n<br />\n<br />[b]- Barrels -[/b]\n<br /> All 7 barrel models shared between the Pipe Rifle, Pipe Bolt Action &amp; Pipe Revolver.\n<br />--\n<br />[b]- Grips -[/b] \n<br />All 6 Grip models\xa0shared between the Pipe Rifle, Pipe Bolt Action &amp; Pipe Revolver.\n<br />--\n<br />[b]- Sights -[/b] \n<br />Reflex, Glow Reflex, &amp; Scope for all 4 weapons. Iron Sights &amp; Night Sights for all except the Pipe Revolver.\n<br />--\n<br />[b]- Muzzles - [/b]\n<br />Largely unchanged, resized to fit new barrels. Suppressor resized &amp; Reshaped to be reasonable.\n<br />--\n<br />[b]- Magazines -[/b]\n<br />All 3 Magazine models resized to fit new receivers.\n<br />--\n<br />[b]- Receivers\xa0-[/b] \n<br />Pipe Rifle/Pistol/SMG &amp; Bolt action entirely remade. Revolver lightly edited for thematic consistency &amp; to fit new barrels. Syringer crudely tweaked to fit new stocks.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />======================================================================\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]Compatibility\n<br />[/b][/size]===\n<br />Far Harbor &amp; Nuka World DLCs are [b]required[/b] for everything to work properly.\n<br />\n<br />This mod only changes the meshes of the weapons and includes no ESPs or ESLs. It should be compatible with every mod that does not directly change the models of the pipe guns and their attachments. In the case of mods that do edit the meshes, this mod will conflict and whichever mod is allowed to overwrite the other will be the one presented in game. I can make no guesses as to how 'mix n' matchin' will work.\n<br />\n<br />This mod is fully compatible with\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/9476]See Through Scopes by henkspamadres[/url]\xfeff [b]without[/b] a patch.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]X- Known Issues -X[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Misplaced Cartridges in 3rd person with the Pipe Bolt-Action Rifle?\n<br />[i]This[/i][/b][i] is a bug present in vanilla Fallout 4 with the PBAR, made more noticeable\xa0\x62y the smaller rear end of my mesh for it. It is one that I cannot/do not know how to fix without removing the bullets from the reload entirely.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[/i][b]Odd Light/Shadows on the weapons?[/b]\n<br />An unavoidable issue with editing meshes as opposed to creating new meshes entirely. It has been fixed as best it can be but may occasionally look odd.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Night Sight/Reflex Sight very dull?[/b]\n<br />This happens occasionally and somewhat randomly. I have not been able to figure out exactly why, I am sorry.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Clipping with X?[/b]\n<br />There may be some minor clipping during some animations or events, or with some armors or setups. I did my best but left some unobtrusive clipping were it was mostly unavoidable.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />=====================================================================\n<br />\n<br />I hope you enjoy this mod, it was fun to make and get back into tinkering with this game. It may not be as impressive as many of the custom mesh makers on here but I was rather pleased with the end product.\n<br />\n<br />If you did enjoy, consider endorsing the mod. It is very validating to get when you worked hard on something. This should go for all mods on the nexus.\n<br />\n<br />My personal appreciation to user\xa0[url=http://https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/46621793/]NummusVersari[/url]\xfeff who showed me how to first use BS Studio.[/center]"
