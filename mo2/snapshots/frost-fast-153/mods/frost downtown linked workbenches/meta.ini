nexusDescription="[size=3][color=#f1c232]Downtown is pretty much the only safe settlement in FROST and is where you will likely spend a lot of your time while trying to survive. It has just about everything you need except for a Power Armor station, cooking station[/color][color=#00ffff]*[/color][color=#f1c232] and weapon workbench. This patch adds these additional workbenches as well as an armor workbench to Valenti Station.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[/color]All the workbenches in Downtown and Valenti Station have been linked to each other with shared safe storage.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b]The new workbench locations are as follows:\n<br />[/b][color=#ffff00]Weapon workbench (Downtown)[/color] \x2013 enclosed shack next to blue load door leading to \x201c\x65mpty\x201d downtown cell.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00]Power Armor station (Downtown)[/color] - \x201c\x45mpty\x201d Downtown cell, tucked into the corner next the shack with the blue load door leading to the populated Downtown cell.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00]Cooking Station (Blue stove, Downtown, populated cell)[/color] \x2013 On the shack platform adjacent to the \x201c\x63rops\x201d and shack with the Chemistry station.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00]Armor workbench (Valenti Station)[/color] \x2013 Next to the already existing Weapon workbench from FROST.\n<br />\n<br />See photo section for screenshots of exact locations.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />All workbenches are linked to a common storage container set to not respawn. Put an item into one workbench, and it will be accessible from all the other workbenches.\xa0\n<br />[color=#00ffff]\n<br />*[/color]There is already a cooking station in the cell adjacent to Downtown \"proper\" but I wanted one right in the \"heart\" of the city where I didn\x2019t need to go through a load screen to cook food or boil water.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ffff00]IMPORTANT! Before installing this mod mid-playthrough:[/color] REMOVE ALL ITEMS STORED IN EXISTING DOWNTOWN WORKBENCHES! [/b]If you do not remove items stored in the existing Downtown workbenches, then activate this mod you will loose access to those items. Remove all items from workbenches FIRST, then activate the mod.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232][b]Optional file - ESP with ESL header flag:\xa0[/b][/color]\n<br />An ESP with an ESL header flag has been added to the Optional Files. The form IDs needed to be compacted to do this, so\xa0[b]I highly recommend only using the ESL flagged file on a NEW game.[/b]\xa0[color=#ffff00][b]Don't use it on an existing save![/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232][b]Technical note on the Valenti Station cell:\n<br />[/b][/color]In vanilla Fallout 4, the Valenti Station cell (NorthEndValentiStation) is an unmarked location simply called \x201cSubway Station.\x201d The locked door leading from the station to the hallway connecting to Downtown is added by FROST. The vanilla game has a static door blocked by metal sub fences in this spot. In order for this patch to function properly, I had to copy the FROST edits made with this door from the FROST .esp into my mod, otherwise the vanilla object would reappear blocking you from entering the main part of the station. FROST simply deleted those references, while the best practice for modding vanilla cells is to set such items to Initially Disabled. The \"Undelete and Disable\" function in xEdit was run to address this. This was done ONLY for this one cell, as it is part of my mod and I\x2019m a bit picky about not deleting vanilla refs.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[/size][size=3][b][color=#f1c232]Other Notes:\n<br />[/color][/b]1. This mod is PC only. There will not be a console version, so please do not ask.\n<br />\n<br />2. Based on any texture replacements you have installed in your game, the appearance of items in the mod may vary from what is shown in the screenshots and promo video. I use many texture replacements in my game and videos, and none of them are included in this mod.\n<br />\n<br />I use the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/17631/?]Decent Plus ENB preset[/url]\xfeff for my screenshots, videos and gameplay.\n<br />[/size][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/38167085/?tb=mods&amp;pUp=1]\n<br />[img]http://www.sublevel3.com/nexus/tags/rrtv-mods-tag.jpg[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUJxQOW5zmdg2ucaOYIj3Kw]\n<br />[img]http://www.sublevel3.com/nexus/mfi/nexus-rrtv-banner.png[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#f1c232][size=4]YouTubers:\n<br />[/size][/color][/b][b][color=#ffff00][size=3]You are welcome to use/showcase my mods in your reviews, mod showcases, and Let's Play videos. \n<br />But, you ARE NOT under any circumstances\xa0\x61llowed to upload, share or otherwise distribute this mod or any of its files to any mod \x201csharing\x201d service such as ModDrop.[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232][size=4][b]Licensing/Legal:\xa0[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[size=3]Do not redistribute or alter this work or any of the files contained therein without explicit written consent from the original author (RedRocketTV).
