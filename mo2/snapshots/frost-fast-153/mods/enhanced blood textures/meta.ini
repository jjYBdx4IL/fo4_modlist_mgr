This will revert the decal amount to vanilla that can improve performance on lower end systems. (can be used with both versions of the mod)\n<br />\n<br />[b]Standard Version Changes:[/b]\n<br />-General edits to scripts and plugin\n<br />-Reduced amount of decals produced by blood pools making the \"animation\" less smooth to improve performance when looking at them\n<br />-Synth will now bleed oil\n<br />-Blood pools will now appear when a victim was only hit with melee weapons\n<br />-Added dying spasms: 50% chance of occurring and won't work on dismembered victims due to limbs and gibs reacting to impulse. You can stop someone's spasm by dismembering them\n<br />-Reduced spasm chance to 15%\n<br />-Reduced spasm duration and impulse\n<br />-Chance can be changed or disabled through console command (0-100): set zxblood_spasmchance to 15\n<br />-Fixed damage over time effects and other \"magic\" damage causing blood splatters (Burning, electricity, ect.)\n<br />-Flamer and Cryolater will no longer cause scripted bleeding. The game's normal blood splatters will still produce a lot of blood from the weapons.\n<br />[b]HOTFIX:[/b]\n<br />-Fixed issue with non-bleeding attacks causing the scripted blood splatters and pooling to stop working.\n<br />\n<br />=====================\n<br />[color=#00ffff][b]Known Issues with the Game Engine[/b][/color]\n<br />=====================\n<br />*\xa0 Buggy looking wounds and fading out after one hit\n<br />*\xa0 Wounds will stop working when loading a save game twice in a session (without restarting the game)\n<br />*\xa0 Most surfaces will not work with decals created with scripts. You will see this for indoor areas or roads. (This what makes the standard version obsolete)\n<br />*\xa0 All creatures will not create wounds!\n<br />*\xa0 Cannibalism blood splatter will glow in the dark\n<br />*\xa0 Problems with white blood reflections are caused by a bug with the game's lighting. It can appear randomly, after rainy weather, or loading a save at an indoor location. This will have the same effect on the vanilla decals.

This can cause blood decals and puddles to look very dark or flat\n<br />\n<br />=====================\n<br />[color=#00ffff][b]Uninstalling (Standard)[/b][/color]\n<br />=====================\n<br />-Open the console ~ key\n<br />-type:\n<br />set zxBlood_isEnabled to 0\n<br />StopQuest zxBleedingModQuest\n<br />-Remove all textures and plugins that came from this mod\n<br />Use of mod installer is recommended\n<br />\n<br />-For basic version you just uninstall the mod with your mod installer.\n<br />\n<br />=====================\n<br />[b][color=#00ffff]Notes[/color][/b]\n<br />=====================\n<br />[b]Performence?[/b]\n<br />-Use lower resolution textures if you are experiencing slowdowns with many blood decals in the area\n<br />-Use the plugin file called Limited Blood Decals. This will revert the blood amount back to vanilla default\n<br />-Deleting or reducing the customini changes to fDecalLifetime and fDecalLOD0 settings number\n<br />-Disabling surface reflection will also improve performance\n<br />-Use basic version\n<br />\n<br />[b]-Chrome stuff looking bad or grey?[/b] Do not install the \"Dark Outdoor Cubemap\" when installing the mod.
