## Installation

You can ignore the following installation steps if you load the included save game.

### MCM Configuration

When you have finished character setup, hit _ESC_ and click _Mod Config_.

NPCs Travel is the only one which *must* be configured.

* NPCs Travel > Number of NPCs > set Synth Patrol to 0
* NPCs Travel > Number of NPCs > DLC > set everything under Far Harbor to 0, including Nuka-World and Nuka-World Open Season

### Holotape Configuration

There are optional settings accessible via Pip-Boy holotapes. You can craft them at any Chemistry Table.

You are done with installation!

## Notes

- Some plugins are disabled because of bugs (see below).
- Some plugins are disabled but not removed because the meta information is used to download archives from nexus mods website. For such plugins, use MO2 to download the archive, then install the archive by unselecting all contained files and ignoring the MO2 warning.

## Bugs

- FROST Lore Tweaked Sanity Loss: disabled because it prevents sanity from falling.
