nexusDescription="[size=5][b]Description[/b]\n<br />[/size]In vanilla FO4, the ArcJet building has two states: prior to \"Call to Arms\", and after. In the default (prior) state, very little of the building can be explored. It is opened up fully only upon arrival here with Danse, during that quest.\n<br />\n<br />Vanilla quests are disabled in FROST, so ArcJet remains mostly off limits. This mod aims to change that without being too heavy-handed with the modifications. Note that before the war, ArcJet heavily guarded its secrets; those guards are still in place in 2082. Do not expect a walking simulator. Do not expect sneak to be broken in here. Bring mines and throwables. Your reward for surviving will be a decent amount of fusion cells, though nothing like what vanilla will give you.\n<br />\n<br />Highlights from the first cell:[list]\n<br />[*]The path Danse would lead you through is now open. Even the vanilla shortcut you can take to bypass most of the first cell is available, though beware of the protectron that can see you doing this\n<br />[*]The synths you would encounter here are replaced with deadly accurate Protectrons\n<br />[*]The jetpack-only room now has a ladder you can use\n<br />[*]The two dead but lootable turrets are now live\n<br />[*]If you use the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/48839]FROST Unofficial Updates[/url] (you really should), the air is irradiated (due to the broken ceilings), so keep that gas mask on\n<br />[*]The vanilla lore no longer requires hacking perks\n<br />[*]...but the high-value safe can't be opened with the terminal any more, so bring lockpicking\n<br />[*]Lots of filing cabinets means potential schematics (no guaranteed drops though)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Highlights from the second cell (Engine Control Room):[list]\n<br />[*]You can't enable the power (the power terminal has a checksum error in 2082) so no engine firing and no elevator\n<br />[*]...but you don't need the elevator, as the catwalks haven't collapsed yet (but mind the broken catwalks littering the floor, these things were needing repairs even before the war)\n<br />[*]With no engine firing there's no rain storm of protectrons, but watch for patrollers\n<br />[*]The Junk Jet and fusion core are here for the taking, but not the Fat Man\n<br />[*]Dr. McClellan's terminal, with vanilla lore that's easy to miss in vanilla, is easy to find, though beware the green glow getting there\n<br />[*]New (dead) NPC to find with a bit of FROSTian lore\n<br />[*]The exit elevator doesn't need power, it's always on, though at the outside exit you might notice that you won't be able to return down this path after the cell resets\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=5][b]Requirements[/b]\n<br />[/size][list]\n<br />[*]Game version 1.10.162 or later.\n<br />[*]FROST.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=5][b]Notes[/b]\n<br />[/size][list]\n<br />[*]ESL-flagged ESP, so it doesn't count against the 255 limit.\n<br />[*]Does not break precombines or previs.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=5][b]Load Order[/b]\n<br />[/size][list]\n<br />[*]Load this after FROST. You can put it right next to my other \"FROST-Accessible\" mods if you're using them.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=5][b]Installation[/b]\n<br />[/size]Install using your favorite method. Uninstall mods at your own risk as usual (best to never do this, honestly). This mod uses no scripts and without it, ArcJet is hardly worth visiting, so maybe it's safe?\n<br />\n<br />My other mods:[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/43146]Red Rocket Glowing Sea Settlement[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/44394]Expanded Quick-Clean Jamaica Plain[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/44938]Dalton Farm - No Trap Barnacles[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/45219]Auto Hack[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/54564]FROST - Accessible Med-Tek Research[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/54873]FROST - Accessible Fort Strong[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/55398]FROST - Accessible Fort Hagen[/url]\n<br />[/list]"
