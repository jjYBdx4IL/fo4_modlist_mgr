nexusDescription="Adds a small home for Federation loyalists in Downtown in between the armor workbench and the chemistry station. Is sparsely populated, but you have a bed, dirty water, cooking station,\xa0 and plenty of storage. There is not enough room for any more workbenches. I tried.\n<br />\n<br />Key is found near Patriot Station on a fallen soldier.\n<br />\n<br />.2 Version:\n<br />Adds Chemistry, Cooking, and Armor workbench to Valenti Storage room and then locks the door on you. :)\n<br />Find Phil to get the key back. Check the note at the door for location.\n<br />\n<br />Adds a home near the workstation room, in Valenti Station,\xa0 with beds and safe storage. \n<br />\n<br />Kept everything sparse because no one is that rich now and so you can customize it if you want. \n<br />\n<br />Version .23 removes the key requirement for the monohome on accident. It is a pain to patch esps with ck. \n<br />.2 delayed till i can figure out why vanilla valenti is spawning on top of this."
