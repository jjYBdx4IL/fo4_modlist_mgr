nexusDescription="In the vanilla game, most locations occupied by humans would actually be death traps during radstorms or worse, during the winter.\n<br />\n<br />Content:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Locations will look more lived in, sturdy and warm. \n<br />[*]Darker world where all fire based lights that are not in areas where people would feed them have been removed.\n<br />[*]Slightly more decoration here and there.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />For settlements locations, download the optional file. I separated them to \n<br />minimize the risk of conflicts. This file includes minor changes to :\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Hangman's alley,\n<br />[*]Oberland station, \n<br />[*]Greentop Nursery, \n<br />[*]Sommerville place, \n<br />[*]The Slog, \n<br />[*]County Crossing, \n<br />[*]Nordhagen beach, \n<br />[*]Warwick Homestead,\n<br />[*]Kingsport Lighthouse,\n<br />[*]Outpost Zimonja.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />This mod shouldn't have a big impact on FPS/performance as it only breaks precombines at the atomcats garage and nowhere else.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/49865]Vanilla version is available[/url].\n<br />\n<br />Suggested Load Order: \n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]FROST\n<br />[*][i]FROSTfix (Boston fps fix)[/i]\n<br />[*][i]FROST - It Snowed[/i]\n<br />[*][i]Winter Commonwealth Pines[/i]\n<br />[*][b]FROST - Hunkered\xa0 Down[/b]\n<br />[*][b]FROST - Hunkered Down-Settlements[/b]\n<br />[*][i]FROST Cell Fixes[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Known issues: \n<br />During testing I had a strange glitch where, if upon loading the mod for the first time I fast travelled to a highway location, the highway LOD would not disappear. It fixed itself upon reloading/restarting the game or by loading the mod away from the highways.\n<br />\n<br />Areas covered by this mod (the following map isn't 100% complete but shows the major edits):\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/49865/49865-1612476187-1462837756.jpeg[/img]"
