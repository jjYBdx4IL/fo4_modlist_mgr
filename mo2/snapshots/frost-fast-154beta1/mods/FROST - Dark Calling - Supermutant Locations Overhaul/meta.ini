nexusDescription="[b]Lore Wise:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Shortly after the war, the world turned to shit. The [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/49227]snows started earlier than usual[/url] and, by the end of October, the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/49094]world had become dark and frozen[/url]. \n<br />\n<br />What little remained of Mankind sought refuge underground to avoid the worst of the fallout. Some survivors managed to find a place in the old subway tunnels, misguidedly hoping that things could get better there; while others chose to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/50008]hunker down[/url] wherever they could in the ruins laden corpse of the old world.\n<br />\n<br />But in the midst of all that chaos and destruction there were those who didn't even try to hold on to their humanity and who, instead, yielded to the Dark Calling of their worst impulses. \n<br />\n<br />This is their stories.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]More Concretely:\n<br />\n<br />[/b]In Frost, supermutant locations are filled with blood, gore and ghouls. This mod updates those locations to make them more immersive for the world of Frost. \n<br />\n<br />The modifications range from simply removing lit fire barrels, oil lamps and suspended meat bags (since ghouls can't really use those), to crafting new environmental stories, to adding a few \"scripted\" encounters. \n<br />\n<br />The locations with the new encounters are : [spoiler] \n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]West Everett Estates, \n<br />[*]Revere Satellite Array, \n<br />[*]Natick Church, \n<br />[*]Fallons Department Store \n<br />[*]Faneuil Hall \n<br />[/list][/spoiler]\n<br />It also adds a new food item, the cannibal's favourite treat: [b]edible Human Eyeballs. [/b]They will feed you, and provide an effect similar to jet but they will, of course, take you deeper into the pit of insanity.\n<br />\n<br />The mod does not break precombines.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Load Order:\n<br />\n<br />[/b][list]\n<br />[*][i]FROST[/i]\n<br />[*][i]FROSTfix (Boston fps fix)[/i]\n<br />[*]FROST - Snowy Weathers[i][/i]\n<br />[*]FROST - It Snowed\n<br />[*][i]Winter Commonwealth Pines[/i]\n<br />[*][b]FROST - SuperMutantLocations[/b][i][/i]\n<br />[*]FROST - Hunkered\xa0 Down\n<br />[*]FROST - Hunkered Down-Settlements\n<br />[*][i]FROST Cell Fixes[/i]\n<br />[/list][b]\n<br />Modified Locations:\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/50618/50618-1615165528-1612859448.jpeg[/img]\n<br />[/b]"
