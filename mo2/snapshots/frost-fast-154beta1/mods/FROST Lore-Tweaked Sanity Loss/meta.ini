nexusDescription="[size=4][b]DESCRIPTION\n<br />[/b][/size]As the short description says, you will no longer uniformly lose 2 sanity for killing a human regardless of what faction they were in.\n<br />New sanity loss values are as follows:\n<br />[size=3][i]Federation and Survivors:[/i]\xa0\x32 Sanity (The former at least acts friendly towards you, and the latter just wants to [s]grill[/s]\xa0survive for god's sake!)[/size]\n<br />[i][size=3]Alliance:\xa0[/size][/i][size=3]1 Sanity (Something, something, based and Marchand-pilled)[/size]\n<br />[i][size=3]Remnants: [/size][/i][size=3]0.4 Sanity (Soldiers, the arm of violence serving a government that wants to crush you and everyone you've ever known)[/size]\n<br />[i][size=3]Maldenmen:[/size][/i][size=3]\xa0\x30.2 Sanity (Poor survivors of a great tragedy, but can you not eat people...FOR FIVE MINUTES?!)[/size]\n<br />[i][size=3]Themis:[/size][/i][size=3]\xa0\x30.1 Sanity (I don't want your scientology on steroids!)[/size]\n<br />[s]Once I figure out MCM you (the player) will be able to adjust all of those values with a slider or manual value input.\n<br />[/s][size=4]MCM has been implemented as of v2.0! Featuring both base sanity loss sliders and additional ones for faction\n<br />[/size]For faction sliders - Positive value = even more sanity loss, Negative value = reduction of sanity loss.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]LOAD ORDER\n<br />[/b][/size]Put [i]ArgonnFROSTSanityTweakPatch.esp [/i]anywhere below FROST.esp. Load the mod as a whole below FROST so that its script overwrites the original.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]TECHNICAL STUFF\n<br />[/b][/size]The ESP extends upon FROST.esp's original edits to the player to attach faction properties to the sanity script.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]CREDITS\n<br />[/b][/size]Naugrim04 - FROST and its Sanity Script\n<br />Alison - Suggesting the changes to me"
