nexusDescription="Simple Retexture for FROST. (Now without any snow in interior cells - where it makes sense).\n<br />\n<br />Some textures have been reused (with permission), lots have been remade from scratch. It aims to bring a more vibrant set of winter textures to Frost\n<br /> and is loosely inspired by The Long Dark. \n<br />\n<br />The textures themselves are based on and expanded upon Flecked's Winter Redone, who was kind enough to allow me to publish this mod. Check Flecked [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/52258856?tab=user+files]other mods[/url], in particular [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41099]Winter Commonwealth Pines[/url], which is the perfect addition to have along with It Snowed (as you'll see in the screenshots). \n<br />\n<br />They are loose files (needed to work with FROST) so, use a mod manager or backup your data before installing it. \n<br />\n<br />In addition to the winter textures, this mod mutes all ambient sounds of insects and cicadas because well ... it's winter.\n<br />\n<br />It also has the benefit of fixing most (if not all) of Frost's black terrain textures. \n<br />\n<br />The latest version now has immersive snowy interiors for buildings with dilapidated roofs. \n<br />\n<br />Load Order: \n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]FROST\n<br />[*]FROST - It Snowed\n<br />[*]Winter Commonwealth Pines\n<br />[/list]This mod is the first step in a series of projects inspired by The Long Dark. The next project will be a simple snowy weather mod for Frost. \n<br />\n<br />version 1.2: \n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Added snow in Fallons Department Store, Gnn Plaza, Boston Public Library and a few other minor locations.\xa0\n<br />[/list]version 1.1: \n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Tweak grass density in the marsh\n<br />[*]Added more snowy plants and mosses\n<br />[*]Fixed the issue where some warehouses' windows were white\n<br />[*]Removed snow in 20+ cells (Most subways should be clear of snow, but there are probably still a few other locations with snow. Let me know if you find any and I will update the mod). These changes should not break precombines anywhere.\n<br />[*]Adds snow to interiors with a broken roof (Cambridge polymer, Museum of Freedom, Arcjet, Vim HQ, Hardware town, Fort Strong)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Potential issue with v1.1: \n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]If you are NOT using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/48425]Frost interior cell fixes[/url]\xfeff, you may run into issues where some Frost cells contain vanilla stuff. I fixed that issue for the third rail but there may be others. Quick solution: use Frost interior cell fixes (load after \"It Snowed\"), or let me know and I might be able to solve it and update.\xa0 \n<br />[/list]\n<br />Feedback (and bug report) is more than welcomed."
