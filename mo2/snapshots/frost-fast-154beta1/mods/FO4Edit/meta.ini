Those changes are \n<br />described in What's New and a document in rich text format is included \n<br />with xEdit for offline viewing.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#00BFFF]Become a Patreon:[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.patreon.com/ElminsterAU]ElminsterAU's Patreon Page[/url]\n<br />\n<br />ElminsterAU has created a Patreon Page to outline his future xEdit development goals.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#00BFFF]Current Documentation:[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />The Fallout 3 training manual was converted by EpFwip in 2013 to HTML \n<br />format. This conversion has been updated as the official and current \n<br />documentation for all versions of xEdit.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://tes5edit.github.io/docs/]Tome of xEdit[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#00BFFF]Previous Documentation:[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />The original Fallout 3 and Fallout NV training manuals are still available for download for offline viewing in PDF format.\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://fallout3.nexusmods.com/mods/8629]Fallout3 Training Manual[/url] for FO3Edit (applies to all game versions)\n<br />[url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/38413]FNVEdit Training Manual[/url] for FNVEdit (applies to all game versions)\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#00BFFF]Wiki Pages:[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Originally pages were available at the Bethesda CK Wiki. Some pages have already \n<br />been depreciated and others will be depreciated once the xEdit \n<br />documentation has been updated.\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=Category:TES5Edit]TES5Edit[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#00BFFF]Official Forums:[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://bethesda.net/community/topic/57570/relz-sseedit]Bethesda Forum[/url] and [url=https://afkmods.iguanadons.net/index.php?/topic/3750-wipz-tes5edit/]AFK Forum[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#00BFFF]Mods made without the GECK/CS/CK:[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />We understand that many authors avoid the Official tools like the GECK, \n<br />Creation Set, or Creation Kit in favor of xEdit. However mod authors \n<br />should be saving and updating their mods with the official tools as \n<br />often as they can tolerate.  Not doing so has lead to situations where \n<br />records must be recreated from scratch.\n<br />\n<br />Almost all games received some kind of changes to their record decoding for the 4.0 update.  One \n<br />example would be OMOD records for Fallout 4. We discouraged authors from\n<br /> modifying OMOD in xEdit because it was not decoded properly with \n<br />original versions of xEdit prior to the release of the Fallout 4 CK.  \n<br />Some records for previous versions prior to 4.0 were still not properly \n<br />decoded. Elminster has made corrections in 4.0. Therefore 4.0 is a \n<br />required update and using previous versions will cause irreversible \n<br />errors.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#00BFFF]Change Log:[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />The changes have been moved to the What's New document.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#FF8C00]FAQ:[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Q: I have the following errors with one of my plugins what do I do?\n<br />\n<br />[00:43] Background Loader: Error: record ARMA contains unexpected (or out of order) subrecord MODL\n<br />[00:43] Background Loader: Errors were found in: ShieldofYsgramorDraugrAA [ARMA:01001001]\n<br />[00:43] Background Loader: Contained subrecords: EDID BODT RNAM DNAM MOD2 MO2T \n<br />MOD3 MO3T MOD4 MO4T MOD5 MO5T SNDD NAM0 NAM1 NAM2 NAM3 MODL MODL MODL \n<br />MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL \n<br />MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL MODL\n<br />\n<br />A: Occurs with plugins made with the ReProccer, NPC Editor or other 3rd party tools. These \n<br />cannot be corrected with xEdit. You can try using the official Bethesda \n<br />Editor but the official tool may not be able to correct the errors with \n<br />loss of data.\n<br />\n<br />Q: The Font is too small, I have a 4K or Hi-Res monitor. I can't read the text how do I increase the size?\n<br />\n<br />A: There is some support for font scaling for Large Size, Hi-Res, or 4K \n<br />monitors. This will help readability but in some situations there is no \n<br />control for popup boxes that expect input from the user.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#00BFFF]xEdit Team Members:[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/users/167469/?]ElminsterAU[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/users/1102380/?]Hlp[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/users/156622/?]Zilav[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/users/4147439/?]Sharlikran[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#00BFFF]Community members who have contributed in some way:[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[i]Listed in alphabetical order[/i]\n<br />\n<br />AndalayBay: Without her help getting me in touch with Elminster we would all still \n<br />be waiting for confirmed record definitions, and even longer for a \n<br />working TES5Edit.\n<br />Divstator: for his work on Improved NavMesh Decoding\n<br />fireundubh: for all his record decoding suggestions for FO4Edit\n<br />Jonathan Ostrus: For his significant contributions to the FO76 record definitions\n<br />jonwd7: for his work on Improved NavMesh Decoding\n<br />shad0wshayd3: for his work on Enderal support and a number of UI tweaks"
