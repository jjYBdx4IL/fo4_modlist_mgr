nexusDescription="It modifies two of Frost's weathers to get a light/stormy snow and a foggy heavy snow. \n<br />\n<br />The snow mostly doesn't clip through buildings, with a few minor glitches during weather transitions (windy weathers will push the snow through wall on occasion. Can't do anything about that) and some buildings where rain occlusion isn't working perfectly (such as Warwick homestead, buildings with steep roofs and the red rockets). \n<br />\n<br />I kept the black rain and the rad storm rain as they were, because they kind of fit well with my winter textures for Frost ([url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/49094?tab=description]It Snowed[/url]) - which just got a major update - and with Frost's original winter textures.\n<br />\n<br />Still, I was considering replacing the regular rad storm rain with snow but I wasn't sure. Let me know if you think Frost's world needs more snow and I might update the mod. \n<br />\n<br />Since screenshots don't say much for weathers, you may want to just try it in game. Use the following console commands to trigger the weathers: \n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]fw 01c3473 (For the foggy snow)\n<br />[*]fw 030074fa (For the stormy snow. 03 is for Far Harbor, but it may be in a different position in your load order).\n<br />\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Finally, I am using the snowflakes made by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/40383990]Mandragorasprouts[/url], who made them for the mod [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/35083?tab=description]Polluted Climate - Winter Edition[/url]."
