nexusDescription="[img]https://i.ibb.co/h8K39H1/UEL-Description.png[/img]\n<br />[b][size=4]This mod is a follow on from my [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/22101/?]Ultra Interior Lighting[/url] mod but for the exterior Fallout 4 world.\n<br />\n<br />This mod adds over 1500 shadow cast lights to physical lights in the Fallout 4 world including the Commonwealth, Far Harbor and Nuka World and generally improves all the lighting associated with physical lights including the ambient and reflective lighting bringing you a vastly improved lighting experience from what you encounter in the vanilla game.\n<br />\n<br />Almost all the new shadow casts lights use a trigger box that swaps them to there non-shadow cast version at X distance from player depending on the location and other factors.\n<br />The use of trigger lights allows for better distance lighting and helps improve the performance by not having shadows rendered where there not really visible or at too far a distance to be visually noticeable. \n<br />\n<br />[/size][/b][img]https://i.ibb.co/nBTRSgW/UEL-WIP.png[/img]\n<br />[b][size=4]As of version 1.0 release the mod is around 80% complete, I will continue to work on the mod until I am happy with the final product!\n<br />[/size][/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.ibb.co/fpJ2Mzy/UEL-Notes.png[/img]\n<br />[b][size=4]This mod does not change any environmental lighting like weathers and weather image spaces and does not touch any vanilla settlement lights - settlements will be covered in an add-on for the mod at a later date.\n<br />\n<br />For performance reasons this mod does not add shadow lights to all physical light sources in the game.\n<br />\n<br />The mod does not break any pre-combines or pre-vis and has been thoroughly cleaned using FO4edit.\n<br />\n<br />Performance will vary from system to system, please bare in mind that the mod brings many shadow casting lights to the exterior Fallout 4 world.\n<br />\n<br />You may or may not occasionally see the flicking of the lights as they swap from non-shadow cast to shadow cast and vice-versa. I have done my best to ensure this issue is not very noticeable but having them swap is a far better option then not both for performance and visual reasons.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/b][img]https://i.ibb.co/TgXzPkz/UEL-Recommended.png[/img]\n<br />[b][size=4]All screenshots have been taken whilst using the\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/191]Darker Nights Mod[/url] and I highly recommend this mod to be used in conjunction with \xfeff this one.\n<br />Any ENB, Reshade or SweetFX configuration that increases the contrast in the game.\n<br />Any weather mod or above that makes night weather darker than vanilla.\n<br />[img]https://i.ibb.co/KwC9mrY/UEL-Requirements.png[/img]\n<br />This mod requires the Nuka World, Far Harbor, Vault-Tec Workshop and the Automatron DLC's. There will not be a non-DLC version so please do not ask!\n<br />[img]https://i.ibb.co/RHzyJqC/UEL-Compatibility.png[/img]\n<br />This mod is in no way compatible with any mod that changes existing vanilla physical light objects or light sources in the exterior world of the Commonwealth, Far Harbor and Nukaworld.\n<br />Mods that edit exterior cells should be placed above this one in your load unless they change pre-combines or pre-vis in which case compatibility is not guaranteed.\n<br />Any mod that allows scrapping of objects in cells other then vanilla settlements should be used with extreme caution as scrapping any physical light objects will cause problems.\n<br />Non vanilla settlement mods are fine as long as they do not touch lights or light sources.\n<br />[img]https://i.ibb.co/nM2bcXM/UEL-Install.png[/img]\n<br />Install as usual with Vortex or simple extract the archive into your Fallot 4 Data folder!\n<br />Loose files are in the archive for safety reasons only to prevent them from being overwritten by another mod.\n<br /> Advanced users may choose not to install them as they also reside in the BA2 archive file.\n<br />Users of the Ultra Interior Lighting mod can simply just overwrite that mods loose assets as they are the same with this mod.\n<br />[img]https://i.ibb.co/yqd2Ks4/UEL-Uninstall.png[/img]\n<br />If you really must uninstall this mod then please save your game in an interior cell before doing say. This is not absolutely necessary but any triggered lights will remain until you exit the area if you do not!\xa0\n<br />[img]https://i.ibb.co/g6TXsQr/UEL-Credits.png[/img]\n<br />Bethesda and everyone here at Nexusmods that have inspired me to continue work on this mod!\n<br />The creators of [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2737]FO4Edit [/url]for there amazing tool, this mod would not exist without it.\n<br />[img]https://i.ibb.co/MPm5VzZ/UEL-My-FO4-Mods.png[/img]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/22101/?]Ultra Interior Lighting[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/22166/?tab=description]Player Comments and Head Tracking[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/40663]MCM Weather Control[/url]\xfeff\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/b]"
