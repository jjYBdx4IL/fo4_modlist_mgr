nexusDescription="[b][size=5]Description\n<br />[/size][/b]In vanilla FO4, there are several obstacles that block off portions of Fort Strong, some of which are cleared after Elder Maxon asks you to come here in the quest Show No Mercy.\n<br />\n<br />Vanilla factions and quests are disabled in FROST, so the the sublevels of Fort Strong and its hostile inhabitants cannot be fully enjoyed. This mod aims to change that without being too heavy-handed with the modifications.\n<br />\n<br />Do not expect a walking simulator. If you needed a missile launcher to even get inside here, replenish the missiles and bring it inside with you. Note that in both cells, the enemies can be funneled, and as ever, mines and throwables will save the day. There are beds in the first cell, so be sure to save before taking the elevator.\n<br />\n<br />What access to Fort Strong can yield:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]2 more mini-nukes in addition to the 1 you can get without the mod\n<br />[*]A new NPC, with a bit of lore to offer\n<br />[*]A handful of extra rooms to explore in the first area, one of which has a Fat man on display, and another with a Jangles on display, both of which are perma-blocked in vanilla FO4 due to a bug\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b][size=5]Important Note\n<br />[/size][/b]The Fort Strong interiors are ridiculously vulnerable to the \"NPCs don't always re-spawn on reload\" vanilla bug, which is similar to the \"mines don't always re-spawn on reload\" vanilla feature. If you want an easier fight, just keep reloading without quitting/restarting...you may end up only needing to fight 1 enemy. But if you prefer the full experience and enjoyment of dispatching 8 enemies each in 2 cells, be sure to quit the game (all the way to the desktop) and restart each time you are killed, to ensure all the NPCs are re-spawned. (This method works for mines too.)\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Requirements\n<br />[/size][/b][list]\n<br />[*]Game version 1.10.162 or later.\n<br />[*]FROST.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b][size=5]Additional Notes[/size][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] ESL-flagged ESP, so it doesn't count against the 255 limit.\n<br />[*] Does not break precombines or previs.\n<br />[*] If you use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/48839]FROST Unofficial Updates[/url]\xfeff, the air is irradiated in the first cell (due to the shattered atrium), so keep that gas mask on.\n<br />[*] Unfortunately, getting rid of every trace of supermutant gore would require either breaking precombines across both cells, or requiring players to install this mod after FROST interior cell fixes, neither of which I wanted. So I compromised and got rid of the meat bag containers, the blood decals, and the skeletons. The remaining blood, including the shopping carriages, are in the precombines, alas.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b][size=5]Load Order\n<br />[/size][/b]Load this after FROST. You can put it right next to my other \"FROST-Accessible\" mods, listed below, if you're using any. When I'm done with the project I will create an all-in-one, so stay tuned for that.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Installation\n<br />[/size][/b]Install using your favorite method. Uninstall mods at your own risk as usual (best to never do this, honestly). This mod does not add or modify scripts, so maybe it's ok?\n<br />\n<br />My other mods:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/43146]Red Rocket Glowing Sea Settlement[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/44394]Expanded Quick-Clean Jamaica Plain[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/44938]Dalton Farm - No Trap Barnacles[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/45219]Auto Hack[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/53923]FROST - Accessible ArcJet[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/54564]FROST - Accessible Med-Tek Research[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/55398]FROST - Accessible Fort Hagen[/url]\n<br />[/list]"
