nexusDescription="[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]Since the game came out, my inability to easily scrap the junk I find has been a pet peeve of mine. For all the lines of dialogue in the game about the ridiculousness of lugging around random trash, you&#39;d think that someone at Bethesda might&#39;ve figured that some players [/font][i]wouldn&#39;t [/i][font=Lucida Sans Unicode]want to carry twelve vases, a typewriter, a clothing iron, and so on. And yet the game has no built-in functionality to avoid being &#39;that guy&#39;.[/font]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]So I decided to do something about it. This mod is the result.\r<br />[/font][center]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Trebuchet MS][size=5][b]Okay, but what does it actually do?[/b][/size][/font][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]This mod adds the Scavver&#39;s Toolbox to your game, a handy little item you can use to break down junk items into their base components. Using it is as simple as dropping the box on the ground and then activating it. When you do so, a menu with the following options will pop up:[/font]\r<br />[size=2]\r<br />[/size][list]\r<br />[*][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=2][b]Store Junk:[/b] Transfers most of the junk in your inventory into the box, then opens the box so you can look over what was\xa0transferred\xa0\x61nd take back anything you\xa0\x64on&#39;t want to scrap. Remember to pull out any shipments that were transferred over&#33;[/size][/font]\r<br />[*][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=2][b]Scrap Junk:[/b] Scraps the junk that&#39;s currently in the box, then picks the box up again. Anything that can&#39;t be scrapped is\xa0transferred\xa0\x62\x61\x63k to your inventory, too.[/size][/font]\r<br />[*][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=2][b]Open Box:[/b] Opens the inventory of the box without\xa0transferring\xa0\x61nything over.[/size][/font]\r<br />[*][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=2][b]Pick Up:[/b] Picks up the box without scrapping anything it might contain. Anything inside it will be\xa0transferred\xa0into your inventory.[/size][/font]\r<br />[*][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=2][b]Do Nothing:[/b] Do I really need to explain this one?[/size][/font]\r<br />[/list][font=Lucida Sans Unicode]\r<br />[/font][font=Lucida Sans Unicode]The toolbox itself can be crafted at both the chemistry and cooking stations under the &#39;utility&#39; category. It only takes one steel to craft, it weighs nothing, and it&#39;s worth nothing. If you forget it somewhere in the game world you can just craft another and throw it down, but I [/font][i]don&#39;t [/i][font=Lucida Sans Unicode]suggest leaving it anywhere for too long, as I haven&#39;t actually tested what happens when the cell it&#39;s placed in is reset.\r<br />[/font]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Trebuchet MS][size=5][b][center]Compatibility[/center][/b]\r<br />[/size][/font]\r<br />[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]This mod should work fine with pretty much everything, as it makes no edits to anything already in the game. It has no trouble with mods that change the components that junk items yield. The script won&#39;t recognize any newly-added components, but that won&#39;t actually cause any issues -- worst case scenario is that if an item doesn&#39;t break down into any of the components in the base game, the script will just ignore the item in question and add it back to your inventory without scrapping it.\r<br />[/font]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Trebuchet MS][size=5][b][center]Installation Notes[/center][/b][/size][/font]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]There are two different versions of this mod -- one that has the scripts packed into a BA2 archive, and one that keeps them as loose files. You only need one of them.\xa0[/font][font=Lucida Sans Unicode]I recommend using the BA2 version, but if you have issues with the mod not working, you should try out the loose files version before anything else, as some people seem to have issues with scripts in archives not running properly.\r<br />[/font]\r<br />[center]\r<br />[font=Trebuchet MS][size=5][b]Uninstallation[/b][/size][/font][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]Why must you hurt me so?? :&#39;([/font]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]Okay, but seriously, uninstallation is pretty simple. If you&#39;ve got the box placed down somewhere, I suggest you pick it up to make sure there&#39;s nothing still in its inventory. If you don&#39;t, you&#39;ll lose whatever might be stored inside it. After doing so, you can just remove deactivate the .esp and remove the mod files from your Data folder (or uninstall through the mod manager you use). Removing it shouldn&#39;t cause any issues to your game.\r<br />[/font]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Trebuchet MS][size=5][b][center]To Do[/center][/b][/size][/font]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]In it&#39;s current state, the mod is pretty stable, so there isn&#39;t anything that I feel has to be done. But these are things that I might do with it later:\r<br />[/font][size=2]\r<br />[/size][list]\r<br />[*][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=2]Get the script to automatically return shipments to the player&#39;s inventory without scrapping. I wanted to do this originally, but couldn&#39;t quite figure out a good way to do so.[/size][/font]\r<br />[*][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=2]Consider/reconsider the menu. I like it as it is, but maybe in the future I might figure out a way to both store the junk and scrap the junk in one go.[/size][/font]\r<br />[*][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=2]Not directly about the mod itself, but maybe I&#39;ll also write a better description page, haha.[/size][/font]\r<br />[/list][font=Lucida Sans Unicode]\r<br />[/font]"
