nexusDescription="[size=5][b]Description[/b]\n<br />[/size]In vanilla FO4, only a portion of the Med-Tek Research building can be explored before MacCready asks you to come here.\n<br />\n<br />Vanilla companions are disabled in FROST, so the bulk of Med-Tek and its plethora of enemies can't ever be fully enjoyed. This mod aims to change that without being too heavy-handed with the modifications. The challenge here is to get past the airlock without having Jacob's password, which MacCready gives you. To solve this, I introduce a pre-war Med-Tek employee with his own terminal and story (both of which will be sadly lost 205 years later). Your mission is to find this terminal and open those doors.\n<br />\n<br />Do not expect a walking simulator. Do not expect sneak to be broken in here. Bring mines, throwables, ammo, and radiation protection. There are a lot more vials of Prevent in 2082, but you can't take them.\n<br />\n<br />What access to Med-Tek can mean for you:[list]\n<br />[*]Massachusetts Surgical Journal #9 \"Raised by Robots\"\n<br />[*]Fusion core\n<br />[*]7 or so sets of handcuffs, handy if you're using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/27636]Freeze[/url] along with FROST\n<br />[*]Beds\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=5][b]Important Note[/b]\n<br />[/size]The Med-Tek enemies are feral ghouls and turrets in vanilla FO4. In FROST, ferals have radiation auras, which are huge and powerful when you've got glowing ones nearby. If you are being hit with radiation and you try to interact with a terminal, you'll be kicked out, a seemingly unfixable vanilla bug. To reduce the odds of this, I changed the ghouls to protectrons in 2 of the rooms. In my testing this worked fine, but I can't guarantee you won't have an issue. The best workaround is to briefly use God Mode (tgm at the console); this will stop your radiation damage and allow you to interact with terminals. Note that you'll need [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/26163]Unlimited Survival Mode[/url] to use tgm in FROST.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]Requirements[/b]\n<br />[/size][list]\n<br />[*]Game version 1.10.162 or later.\n<br />[*]FROST.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=5][b]Additional Notes[/b]\n<br />[/size][list]\n<br />[*]ESL-flagged ESP, so it doesn't count against the 255 limit.\n<br />[*]Does not break precombines or previs.\n<br />[*]If you use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/48839]FROST Unofficial Updates[/url], the first cell will be irradiated (that's open sky you see when you look up at the holes in the ceiling).\n<br />[*]If you're concerned about the obvious lore issue that arises here -- that it's the FROST player who kills the original Med-Tek subjects, not the Sole Survivor -- consider this. When you leave here, the building is empty and open, but with an actively engaged lockdown mode, and you've got 205 years to fill. In my headcanon, the lockdown mode occasionally re-synchronizes with the doors, but not until some hapless settlers have already moved in and tucked themselves in for the night. 205 years later, it's ghouls trapped in cells all over again.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=5][b]Load Order[/b]\n<br />[/size]Load this after FROST. You can put it right next to my other \"FROST-Accessible\" mods if you're using them.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]Installation[/b]\n<br />[/size]Install using your favorite method. Uninstall mods at your own risk as usual (best to never do this, honestly). This mod does include a small script so honestly, just don't.\n<br />\n<br />My other mods:[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/43146]Red Rocket Glowing Sea Settlement[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/44394]Expanded Quick-Clean Jamaica Plain[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/44938]Dalton Farm - No Trap Barnacles[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/45219]Auto Hack[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/53923]FROST - Accessible ArcJet[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/54873]FROST - Accessible Fort Strong[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/55398]FROST - Accessible Fort Hagen[/url]\n<br />[/list]"
